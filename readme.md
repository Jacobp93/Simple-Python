Please see folders for a collection of code mainly used for utility purposes which i have self coded when required the use of their functions.

For example the PDF / Youtube Converter py files are something which i coded on the fly purely to attain audio for personal use and a Word document version of a document to provide to a colleague.

I plan to further extend the finance folder and numpy folders with future projects surrounding finance and data analaysis of market data.
