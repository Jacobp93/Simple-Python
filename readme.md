Please see folders for a collection of code mainly used for utility purposes which i have self coded when required the use of their functions.

For example the PDF / Youtube Converter py files are something which i coded on the fly purely to attain audio for personal use and a Word document conversion of a CV to avoid paying a fee for adobe acrobat use.

The finance folders contain interactions with apis to return live price data "Binance api / Binance requests" _api keys are required to run_

Binance api - api call with specfic data calls organised into a table upon printed outcome

Binance requests - a simple price api call

Crypto Graph Creation - A graph off live data can be charted in a html file by running this file this doesn't require api keys as Yahoo finance is used which requires no keys _Please be aware this takes a while to appear as an html file due to the speed of python_

Forex Currency - a simple live data currency conversion

Numpy - This folder contains a simple example example of some numpy commands used also used and replicated in Jupyter notebook

Stock Clustering - organised data so that Cluster Analysis may be calculated, stock clustering is "a technique used to group sets of objects that share similar characteristics. It is common in statistics. Investors will use cluster analysis to develop a cluster trading approach"

I plan to further extend the finance folder and numpy folders with future projects surrounding finance and data analaysis of market data.
